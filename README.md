This project was inspired by [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse) and his course: [Python Data Analytics Course](https://github.com/lukebarousse/Python_Data_Analytics_Course).
He analyzes the job postings in the US, but to make the project more meaningful, I decided to apply the same approach to data jobs in the Netherlands. 
By filtering the dataset to Dutch job postings, I focused on answering questions like:

- What are the most common data roles being advertised here?
- Which companies are currently hiring for data roles?
- Which skills and tools (like SQL, Python, or Power BI) show up the most?
- Are there certain cities or regions with more opportunities?
- What is the average salary offered?
